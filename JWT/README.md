# JSON Web Token (JWT)

JWT is an internet standard for creating data with optional signature and/or optional encryption whose payload holds JSON that asserts some number of claims.

JWT tokens are signed either using a private secret or a public/private key.

The tokens are designed to be compact, URL-safe and usable in a web-browser single-sign-on context.
