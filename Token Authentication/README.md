# Token Authentication

A token is a piece of data that has no meaning or use on its own, but comined with the correct tokenization system it becomes a vital player in securing your application.

Token Authentication works by ensuring that each request to a server is accompanied by a signed token which the server verifies for authenticity and only then responds to the request.
